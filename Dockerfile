# RedLens Atlas — single-stage image (deliberately NOT multi-stage / slim).
# The in-process atlas updater re-runs build-index/build-graph and `git fetch` at
# RUNTIME, so the final image MUST carry: bun, git, python3, the build scripts,
# node_modules, and a real atlas git checkout. A slim runtime stage would break
# the updater — that's why this is one stage.
FROM oven/bun:1.3

# git: clone the atlas at build time + the runtime self-update fetch.
# python3: build-index runs the atlas's sync/compose.py (stdlib only) to
#   synthesize the monolithic "Sky Atlas.md" from content/** — it is generated,
#   not committed, so the updater needs python3 at RUNTIME too.
RUN apt-get update \
 && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git ca-certificates python3 \

# Railway strips .git from the Docker build context, so `git submodule update`
# cannot work here. Clone the atlas directly — this also gives the runtime
# updater a clean origin/main to `git fetch` into. Tracks main (matches the
# in-process-updater design); to pin a version, `git checkout <sha>` after clone.
# Then build the lean artifact set (build:railway skips the Etherscan/RPC passes
# — those artifacts are committed and ship in the image).
