# RedLens — Sky Atlas

A search-first reader for the [Sky Atlas](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/next-gen-atlas), the canonical document describing the Sky ecosystem's structure, governance, and operations.

An alternative to [sky-atlas.io](https://sky-atlas.io) with a focus on surfacing the on-chain reality behind the governance text.

## Features

### Search

- **Full-content search** — every node of the Atlas is indexed (lunr.js, Web Worker), so queries hit the entire ~48k-line corpus instantly
- **Chainlog ID search** — type `MCD_VAT`, `USDS`, `REWARDS_LSSKY_SKY`, etc. to find all nodes that reference that contract; results merge with prose matches
- **Address prefix search** — type `0x` or any address prefix to find nodes containing matching addresses
- **Phrase search** — wrap terms in quotes for exact substring matching: `"surplus buffer"`
- **Field filters** — `title:quorum`, `type:Annotation`, `type:Core`
- **Fuzzy match** — `misaligment~1` tolerates typos
- **Wildcards** — `govern*` matches any suffix

### On-chain annotations

Every Ethereum and Solana address mentioned in the Atlas is detected at build time and enriched from two sources:

- **Sky chainlog** — ~400 mainnet contract names (`MCD_VAT`, `USDS`, `SPK`, …) mapped to their canonical label
- **Etherscan** — verified contract name, proxy flag, and implementation address for each EVM address; cached in `.cache/etherscan/` and committed to the repo so contributors don't need an API key

Address metadata shown in the annotations panel for each node:

- Resolved label (chainlog ID wins, then atlas prose label, then Etherscan name)
- Aliases (other names found for the same address across the Atlas)
- Explorer link (Etherscan, Basescan, Arbiscan, etc. per chain)
- Role tags (`multisig`, `proxy`, `oracle`, `treasury`, `staking-rewards`, …)
- Proxy → implementation address
- **Live on-chain view function results** for chainlog contracts (via viem + multicall3, fetched at build time)

### Node detail view

Navigating to a node shows a bounded context window: the parent node, up to 8 siblings above, the target, up to 8 direct children, and up to 8 siblings below — never the entire subtree regardless of Atlas size.

The annotations panel (right column on desktop) shows:

- UUID-linked nodes from the Atlas cross-reference system
- Address cards with on-chain metadata and live view function values

## Build & run locally

Requires [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and Node 22+.

```bash
# clone with the Atlas submodule
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Anscharo/redlens.git
cd redlens
pnpm install
```

If you cloned without `--recurse-submodules`:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=   # https://etherscan.io/apidashboard — needed for build:addresses
ETH_RPC_URL=         # optional; defaults to ethereum.publicnode.com
```

The Etherscan cache (`.cache/etherscan/`) is committed to the repo. If you're not adding new addresses, `build:addresses` will complete in under a second with zero API calls.

### Build scripts

```bash
pnpm build:index      # parse Atlas markdown → public/docs.json + public/search-index.json
pnpm build:addresses  # enrich addresses with chainlog + Etherscan → public/addresses.json
pnpm build:snapshot   # fetch on-chain view function values → public/chain-state.json
pnpm build            # all of the above, then tsc + vite build

pnpm dev              # Vite dev server (requires build:index + build:addresses + build:snapshot first)
pnpm preview          # serve the production build locally
```

## Build at any historical atlas commit

The atlas is a moving target. To audit RedLens against a specific atlas revision, check out the repo and run:

```bash
pnpm build:at <atlas-commit-sha>   # e.g. ede66d5f2cf3…
```

This runs only the deterministic, offline pipeline steps and pins the output manifest to the given atlas commit. No API keys needed. Two people running the same command at the same SHA get byte-identical `docs.json`, `search-index.json`, and `manifest.json`. CI enforces this on every push via `REPRO=1 pnpm test`.

## Atlas MCP server (local)

This repo ships a local [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that exposes the Sky Atlas as queryable tools for Claude Code (or any MCP client). It uses a local vector index over `docs.json` so you can ask natural-language questions about the Atlas without sending any data off your machine.

Three tools are exposed:

- `atlas_search(query, k?, type?)` — semantic search over all 9,825 nodes
- `atlas_get(id)` — fetch a single node by UUID or doc number (e.g. `A.6.1.1.1`)
- `atlas_neighbors(id, window?)` — parent + sibling + child context around a node

### Setup

1. **Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** and pull the embedding model (one-time, ~270 MB):

   ```bash
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   ```

   Ollama must be running at `http://localhost:11434` (the default). Override with `OLLAMA_URL` if you've moved it.

2. **Build the docs index** if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pnpm build:index
   ```

3. **Build the vector index** (embeds all atlas nodes — takes a couple of minutes the first time):

   ```bash
   pnpm build:rag
   ```

   Output lives in `.cache/atlas-rag/` (gitignored). Re-run whenever `docs.json` changes.

4. **Use it.** The repo ships a `.mcp.json` at the root, so any Claude Code session opened in this directory auto-discovers the server. The first time you run a tool, Claude will prompt you to approve it.

### Smoke tests

```bash
pnpm query "what is spark"   # direct RAG query, no MCP layer
node scripts/test-mcp.mjs                     # exercise the JSON-RPC stdio protocol
```

### Notes

- Zero npm dependencies — the server uses only Node built-ins (`fs`, `readline`, `fetch`).
- The vector store is brute-force cosine over an L2-normalized `Float32Array` (~30 MB scan per query, fine for 9,825 nodes).
- Server logs go to stderr; stdout is reserved for JSON-RPC messages.
- Index is **not** auto-rebuilt by `pnpm build` because the web build shouldn't depend on Ollama being online. Run `pnpm build:rag` manually after `build:index` when you want to refresh it.

## Atlas MCP server (hosted)

A hosted MCP server is deployed on Cloudflare Workers, backed by a D1 (SQLite) graph database containing all 9,825 Atlas nodes, a typed edge graph, named entity catalog, and on-chain address data. No local setup required — connect any MCP client directly.

**Endpoint:** `https://redlens-mcp.anscharo.workers.dev/mcp`

### Connecting

Add to your `.mcp.json` or MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "redlens-atlas": {
      "url": "https://redlens-mcp.anscharo.workers.dev/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### REST API

The same Worker also exposes a REST API for the RedLens frontend:

```
GET /api/search?q=<query>&k=<n>&type=<type>   Full-text search
GET /api/node/:id                              Node by UUID or doc number
GET /api/entity/:name                          Entity view (nodes + responsibilities + active data)
GET /api/traverse/:id?hops=2&type=<edge_type>  Graph traversal
```

### Graph database

The D1 database holds:

| Table         | Contents                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `atlas_nodes` | All 9,825 nodes with full content + FTS5 index                                                                                                   |

| `addresses`   | 294 on-chain addresses with chain-state snapshots                                                                                                |
| `edges`       | 12,438 typed edges: `parent_of`, `cites`, `annotates`, `active_data_for`, `member_of`, `member_of_erg`, `has_address`, `mentions`, `proxies_to`  |

### Infrastructure source

The extraction logic is governed by a Claude Code skill — `.claude/skills/graph-atlas/` — which acts as the living spec for how Atlas markdown conventions map to typed edges. When the Atlas introduces a new structural pattern (a new role vocabulary, a new doc-number convention, a new entity type), the skill is updated first and the extraction code follows. This keeps the "markdown → structured data" translation explicit and reviewable outside the code itself.

The graph build script (`scripts/build-graph.mjs`) lives at the repo root — both the frontend and the MCP Worker consume its outputs. The Worker source lives in `redlens-mcp/`. To rebuild the graph database after an Atlas update:

```bash
pnpm build:index                      # regenerate docs.json + addresses.json from source
pnpm --filter redlens-mcp graph:remote  # re-import all tables into D1
pnpm --filter redlens-mcp deploy        # redeploy the Worker
```

## Deployment

`main` is auto-deployed to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The workflow:

- Runs on every push to `main`, daily on a schedule, and on manual trigger
- Pulls the latest upstream Atlas submodule content on each build
- Requires two repository secrets: `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` and `ETH_RPC_URL`
