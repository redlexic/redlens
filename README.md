# RedLens — Sky Atlas

A search-first reader for the [Sky Atlas](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/next-gen-atlas), the canonical document describing the Sky ecosystem's structure, governance, and operations.

An alternative to [sky-atlas.io](https://sky-atlas.io) with a focus on surfacing the on-chain reality behind the governance text.

## Stack

- **Build/dev**: Vite+ + pnpm + TypeScript
- **UI**: React 19 + Tailwind v4
- **Search**: MiniSearch (full-content index, runs in a Web Worker)
- **Markdown**: react-markdown + remark-gfm + KaTeX; custom rehype plugin linkifies on-chain addresses
- **Graph**: graphology (Web Worker) for typed entity/document relationships

## Features

### Search

- **Full-content search** — every node of the Atlas is indexed (MiniSearch, Web Worker), so queries hit the entire ~50k-line corpus instantly
- **Chainlog ID search** — type `MCD_VAT`, `USDS`, `REWARDS_LSSKY_SKY`, etc. to find all nodes that reference that contract
- **Address prefix search** — type `0x` or any address prefix to find nodes containing matching addresses
- **Phrase search** — wrap terms in quotes for exact substring matching: `"surplus buffer"`
- **Field filters** — `title:quorum`, `type:Annotation`, `type:Core`
- **Fuzzy match** — `misaligment~1` tolerates typos
- **Wildcards** — `govern*` matches any suffix

### Atlas reader

Navigate any atlas document to see its full content alongside a contextual annotations panel: linked documents, on-chain addresses, glossary terms, and a change history tab.

### On-chain annotations

Every Ethereum and Solana address mentioned in the Atlas is detected at build time and enriched from two sources:

- **Sky chainlog** — ~400 mainnet contract names mapped to their canonical label
- **Etherscan** — verified contract name, proxy flag, and implementation address; cached and committed so contributors don't need an API key

Address cards show the resolved label, aliases, explorer link, role tags, proxy → implementation, and cached on-chain view-function values.

### Radar

`/radar` — actor profiles for Prime Agents, Facilitators, and other named Sky participants. Shows responsibilities, instances, rewards, and linked atlas sections.

### Constellations

`/constellations` — a visual graph of agents, governance parties, facilitators, and the typed relationships between them, drawn from the build-time graph extraction.

### Reports

`/reports` — cross-cutting views that join across the graph: rewards by primitive, active data by scope, and org facilitator breakdowns.

## Getting started

Requires [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and Node 22+.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Anscharo/redlens.git
cd redlens
pnpm install
```

If you cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, run  `git submodule update --init --recursive` (aliased as `pnpm pull-atlas`) to pull the Atlas source.

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=   # https://etherscan.io/apidashboard — needed for build:addresses
ETH_RPC_URL=         # optional; defaults to ethereum.publicnode.com
```

The Etherscan cache is committed to the repo — if you're not adding new addresses, `build:addresses` completes in under a second with zero API calls.

### Build and run

```bash
pnpm build   # full pipeline (see below) + tsc + vite build
pnpm dev     # Vite dev server (run pnpm build first to generate the data files)
pnpm preview # serve the production build locally
```

## Build pipeline

`pnpm build` runs six data-extraction stages in order before the TypeScript and Vite steps:

| Stage | What it does |
|---|---|
| `build:index` | Parses Sky Atlas.md → node index + full-text search index |
| `build:glossary` | Extracts Definitions sections → glossary lookup |
| `build:addresses` | Enriches on-chain addresses from chainlog + Etherscan → address metadata |
| `build:snapshot` | Reads view-function values via RPC → chain state pinned to a block |
| `build:graph` | Extracts typed relationships from the atlas text → graph artifacts |
| `build:manifest` | sha256 digest of all artifacts → integrity manifest |

### Hosted MCP server data

The frontend bundle has no need for the embedding vectors that power semantic search on the hosted MCP server, so they're built separately:

```bash
pnpm build:server   # build:index + build:graph + build:rag
```

`build:rag` writes `.cache/atlas-vectors/{vectors,ids,meta}` (gitignored, ~30 MB, requires `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` for Workers AI bge-base-en). The `sync-db` workflow runs `pnpm build:server` and then uploads the graph to D1 and the vectors to Cloudflare Vectorize.

Each stage can also be run individually. 

### Build at any historical atlas commit

The atlas is a moving target. To audit RedLens against a specific atlas revision:

```bash
pnpm build:at <atlas-commit-sha>   # e.g. ede66d5f2cf3…
```

This runs only the deterministic, offline pipeline steps and pins the output manifest to the given commit. No API keys needed. Two people running the same command at the same SHA get byte-identical outputs. CI enforces this on every push via `REPRO=1 pnpm test`.

### Per-node history

```bash
pnpm build:history   # walks the atlas git history → public/history/<uuid>.json per node
```

This is not part of `pnpm build` — it's slow and requires GitHub API access for PR metadata. Run it manually when you want the history tab populated.

## Deployment

`main` is auto-deployed to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The workflow runs on every push to `main`, daily on a schedule, and on manual trigger. It requires two repository secrets: `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` and `ETH_RPC_URL`.

## Keeping the atlas up to date

The Sky Atlas is a git submodule at `vendor/next-gen-atlas/`. When the upstream atlas gets a new commit, trigger the **Atlas Update** GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/atlas-update.yml`) — it pulls the submodule, rebuilds all artifacts, and opens a PR.

## Other tools

These are not part of the web app build and are not required for local development.

### ask-atlas agent (Claude Code)

The repo ships a `.claude/agents/ask-atlas.md` subagent definition. In any Claude Code session opened in this directory, type `@ask-atlas` to ask governance questions about the Atlas with exhaustive inline citations:

```
@ask-atlas What does the Atlas say about USDS stability fees?
@ask-atlas Show me the Active Data sections controlled by Spark
@ask-atlas Does the Prime Agent Executor Agent requirement interact with the Allocation System?
```

The agent retrieves answers from the [hosted MCP server](#hosted-mcp-server--worker) (requires the `.mcp.json` connection). It also supports a `learn:` command for persisting external context (forum posts, legal opinions, off-chain agreements) that will be cited in future answers:

```
@ask-atlas learn: [paste content] (source: Sky Forum post by X, 2024-03-15)
```

External knowledge is saved to `.claude/agents/ask-atlas/EXTERNAL.md` and survives across sessions.

### Hosted MCP server + Worker

`redlens-mcp/` is a Cloudflare Worker that hosts a public MCP endpoint and REST API, backed by a D1 graph database containing all atlas nodes, the typed edge graph, named entities, and on-chain address data.

**Endpoint:** `https://redlens-mcp.anscharo.workers.dev/mcp`

See [`redlens-mcp/AGENTS.md`](redlens-mcp/AGENTS.md) for the full tool reference, REST API, database schema, and deployment instructions.

### Auxiliary scripts

`scripts/aux/` holds scripts that are useful for development and research but are not part of the core build:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `check-atlas-pr.sh` | Build the repo against a next-gen-atlas PR and diff artifacts (`pnpm check:pr`) |
| `tva.sh` | Full-history build + test sweep |
| `walk-timeline.sh` | Walks the atlas commit timeline running builds |
| `test-addresses.mjs` | Ad-hoc dumps from address metadata |
| `unlabeled-addresses.mjs` | Lists addresses with no resolved label for triage |
| `processes-triage.sh` | Reconcile the curated process inventory against atlas drift (`pnpm processes:triage`): syncs `main`, creates a branch, runs the `processes-triage` Claude skill interactively, then commits + pushes + opens a PR. Add `--dry-run` to skip git ops. Add `--issue N` to link the PR (`Closes #N`) to the `processes-review` issue opened by atlas-update.yml |
| `processes-apply-decisions.mjs` | Apply a `[{ uuid, verdict: "add" \| "ignore", ... }]` decisions file to `public/processes.json` + `public/processes-ignored.json` (`pnpm processes:apply-decisions <file>`). Consumed by the curation UI on `/reports/processes` (its "Download JSON" output drops in directly) and by the triage skill's batch path |
